In 2020 is [GPT-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3#:~:text=GPT%2D3's%20full%20version%20has,of%20pre%2Dtrained%20language%20representations.) uitgebracht. Een textmodel met maar liefst 175 miljard parameters. Ik zat al een tijdje op de wachtlijst en kreeg afgelopen week een uitnodiging voor de betaversie. En dat is toch wel heel erg leuk en soms verbazingwekkend!

Je kan het model gebruiken door een tekst als input te geven. GPT-3 genereert vervolgens het meest waarschijnlijke vervolg hiervan. Bijvoorbeeld: 
Input> The capital of Thailand is
GPT3> Bangkok

Maar je kan het ook meerdere woorden laten genereren, bijvoorbeeld
Input> The capital of Thailand is
GPT3> Bangkok. กรุงเทพฯ is a Thai word that means "city of angels" or "grand capital", although neither the city nor the country has such an official name in English. The origin of the term "Bangkok" comes from the Thai word "krabang" which can be translated as "water front". Bangkok is known in Thai as Krung Thep Maha Nakhon, which means "City of Angels"

Nog een voorbeeldje:
Input> The square root of 100 is
GPT3> 10.0, and the square root of 49 is 7.0. Do you see that?” I asked.
“Yes, so 49 is 7 times 7.”
“Very good.” I continued, “Now, for the last step, we have to multiply 7 times 7 to get 49. So, 7 times 7 is 49.”
I could see that Benjamin was making a quick mental connection between the problem and the answer.
“So, the answer is 15.”
“Yeah!” he exclaimed.

Now for something more inter

**Eliza is a virtual counselling program. It interacts with clients that share their emotional problems with her. The following is an example narrative, where Eliza and the client interact. The narrative starts with an introduction, then the client describes his problem. Then Eliza probes for root causes and makes a suggestion how the client could improve his wellbeing.

Eliza: Welcome to the counselling session
Client: Thank you. I don't feel well today.**
Eliza: What's wrong? What are your symptoms?
Client: I had a terrible night. My sleep was restless, and I woke up 10 times.
Client: I am tired and I feel kind of numb. I think I am depressed.
Eliza: Tell me more about your depression.
Client: I feel like I am not myself. I am not motivated to do anything.
Client: I woke up at 7 o'clock, but I didn't get out of bed until 10 o'clock.
Client: The day before yesterday I didn't feel like going to work.
Client: I am tired most of the time and I can't concentrate.
Eliza: I see. It sounds like you have a case of the blues.
Eliza: You are feeling numb and down. You do not have the desire to do anything.
Eliza: You do not feel like doing the things you like to do.
Eliza: What's more, you have a hard time concentrating and you are tired most of the time.
Eliza: These are the symptoms of depression.
Eliza: You should know that you are not alone with this.

Client: I am thinking about it.
Eliza: It is important that you talk to someone.
Client: I don't know if I can talk to my parents about it.
Eliza: I understand that talking to your parents could be difficult.
