This play is one of the most popular ones of the 17th century. It's full of jokes, while sketching a very accurate description of peoples everyday problems. For the people that haven't seen it, here is a synopsis:

The play is divided into five acts. The action takes place in Rome, during the Caesar's time.

The play begins with the entrance of the four seasons. They are described one by one by the author. The seasons have a purpose: to set the scene and introduce the characters.

A lady enters the scene. Her nam is Agnes. She is a young widow. Her sister's husband, a famous lawyer, has just died.

Agnes has inherited all his wealth, but she is very sad. Her sister, Constance, encourages her to go outside, to occupy her time with action.

The two women fall in love with the two young sons of an old doctor, named Pedantius.

As the play is a comedy, the love is not true. This is a great chance for the author to make fun of the old and the young, the rich and the poor, the ladies and the lawyers.

The sons go to ask the women's hand. After some struggle, the men are allowed to court the women. They are not allowed to see each other.

Another young woman, called Lucrece, arrive in Pedantius's house. She is a beautiful lady, but she is in love with Pedantius himself. He behaves very coldly towards her.

Her brother, Octavio, is a rich man. He wants to marry Lucrece and to be Pedantius's son-in-law.

At this point, Pedantius and his wife arrive in the scene. They are old, and they are tired of their son's relationship with Lucrece. They tell their son to marry the daughter of Asinius, the legendary lawyer.

This is a parody of the rich people who always want to marry someone who is richer than them.

Pedantius and Agnes have a long conversation about love and marriage. She speaks about her bravery, her modesty, her civility. She talks about the love she has for Pedantius and about the fact that she is not interested in other men.

In the end, Pedantius accepts that Agnes is better than Lucrece. He agrees with the marriage, but he wants the women to fight for him. This is a parody of the old arranged marriages.

The two women enter the scene. They are dressed as warriors, with helmets and shields.

They fight, but Agnes wins. She wins, but she does not want to marry Pedantius. She wants him to marry Lucrece. This is a parody of the inescapable situations that the women have to face at those times.

Pedantius and his father-in-law go to see Asinius, the fantastic lawyer. They want to arrange the marriage of Pedantius with Asinius's daughter.

They arrive at the lawyer's house. They find him planting herbs, and they think he is not a serious man.

Asinius enters. He is an old man, who has pictures of beautiful women all over the walls. He is inspired by the pictures to speak about love and to prove his intelligence.

Asinius proves that he did not lose his ability to love. He proposes marriage to Agnes. The two men accept.

After the marriage, Asinius has a long discussion with Pedantius. They discuss the advantages and disadvantages of marriage. The discussion ends
