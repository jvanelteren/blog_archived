This essay is about the main things people later regret. Their are clearly three main points:

Regrets about career: "I wish I'd played more and worked less" (Gretchen Rubin) "I wish I'd started a business instead of taking a job" (Phil)

Regrets about family: "I wish I'd spent more time with my kids" (Phil) "I wish I'd been more of a father" (Dylan)

Regrets about love: "I wish I'd trusted myself to love more deeply and more freely" (Gretchen) "I wish I'd been less judgmental about my ex's shortcomings" (Dylan)



Each of these regrets is the result of a mistake in judgment. Let's see why, to prevent such mistakes in our own lives.

1. Not making time to make money

Phil, a successful entrepreneur, and his wife both had successful careers. At some point, however, they decided to quit their jobs and start a business. This is a good idea for many people. People who are self-employed are happier on average than people who work for someone else.

The problem here was that neither of them really wanted to do this. Phil wanted to work for someone else, and even felt that his wife would be happier working for someone else. The only reason she went along with the decision was because Phil had basically convinced her that it was a good idea.

"I want to play more and work less"

It's a good idea to only start a business when you are excited and enthusiastic about it. You have to love it. Otherwise, it will be a big struggle. You should be excited about it, and are totally enthusiastic about it.

2. Not spending time with your kids

Phil's wife used to be a stay-at-home mum. She had a very good childhood herself, and was very close to her parents. Around the age of 40, however, she discovered that she had never been close to her own children. She had been too busy playing and working.

"I wish I had spent more time with my kids."

When it comes to marriage and family, you should do whatever makes your wife or husband happiest. You are not their parents. You are a partner in a relationship. That means looking out for their interests, not your own.

3. Being too judgemental

Dylan was an enthusiastic marriage guy. In his 20s he seemed to have it all figured out. He had a wife, a child, and his own business. He was confident and clear-minded.

He managed to go from this state of mind to a complete breakdown in a short period of time. He was consumed by a combination of deep self-doubt, and intense self-judgement. He couldn't make decisions because everything was equally wrong.

"I wish I hadn't been so judgmental of my ex's shortcomings."

If you find yourself in a similar situation, you should think about what it was that led you to this state of mind.

It's easy to blame other people,
