Eliza: Welcome to the counselling session
Client: Thank you. I don't feel well today.
Eliza: What's wrong? What are your symptoms?
Client: I had a terrible night. My sleep was restless, and I woke up 10 times.
Client: I am tired and I feel kind of numb. I think I am depressed.
Eliza: Tell me more about your depression.
Client: I feel like I am not myself. I am not motivated to do anything.
Client: I woke up at 7 o'clock, but I didn't get out of bed until 10 o'clock.
Client: The day before yesterday I didn't feel like going to work.
Client: I am tired most of the time and I can't concentrate.
Eliza: I see. It sounds like you have a case of the blues.
Eliza: You are feeling numb and down. You do not have the desire to do anything.
Eliza: You do not feel like doing the things you like to do.
Eliza: What's more, you have a hard time concentrating and you are tired most of the time.
Eliza: These are the symptoms of depression.
Eliza: You should know that you are not alone with this.
Eliza: It is a serious problem that affects more than ten million Americans every year.
Eliza: Depression makes people feel sad, discouraged, and hopeless.
Eliza: These feelings can lead to suicide.
Eliza: Have you had thoughts about hurting yourself?
Client: Yes.
Eliza: According to my research, suicide is the third most frequent cause of death among adolescents.
Eliza: The most frequent reason for suicide is depression. What's more, there is a strong correlation between suicide and substance abuse.
Eliza: What do you think about that?
Client: I am thinking about it.
Eliza: It is important that you talk to someone.
Client: I don't know if I can talk to my parents about it.
Eliza: I understand that talking to your parents could be difficult.
Eliza: You could talk to a school counsellor.
Eliza: They are trained to help people with your problem.
Eliza: It might be easier to talk to someone who is not a family member.
Client: I can't see a school counsellor.
Eliza: Why not?
Client: I am too embarrassed.
Eliza: Do you have any friends who you could talk to?
Client: I have one friend.
Eliza: Are you comfortable talking to him about this?
Client: I don't think so.
Eliza: What is your friend's name?
Client: Mark.
Eliza: Do you think Mark will help you?
Client: I don't know.
Eliza: What is your relationship like with Mark?
Client: We are friends.
Eliza: Have you ever talked to Mark about this?
Client: No.
Eliza: What do you think Mark will say?
Client: He will try to help me.
Eliza: I see.
Eliza: Do you think this will help?
Client: I don't know.
Eliza: Do you have a pet?
Client: Yes, I do.
Eliza: Pets can be a great source of comfort.
Eliza: They will always be there for you, no matter what happens.
Eliza: You have a pet, and you should be proud of that.
Client: I will try to talk to someone.
Eliza: I am glad to hear that.
Eliza: Would you like to talk about something else?
Client: I think I am ready to end the session.
Eliza: I hope that you have learned something from our session today.
Eliza: It is always important to share your thoughts with someone you trust.
Eliza: There are many people who are willing to listen.
Eliza: Talking can help you to get a better understanding of your problem and find a solution.
Eliza: We talked about the problem, and I gave you some advice.
Eliza: I hope you will remember it.
Eliza: I wish you the best of luck.
Client: Thank you.
Eliza: Goodbye.

Eliza: Welcome to the counselling session
Client: Thank you. I don't feel well today.
Eliza: Tell me more about your problem.
Client: I don't feel well.
Eliza: Tell me more about how you feel.
Client: I just don't feel well. I have a bad headache.
Eliza: Do you have any idea why you have a headache?
Client: I'm not sure.
Eliza: Could it be caused by something that happened in the past?
Client: Yes, something happened.
Client: I had a fight with my girlfriend. I feel very upset and I'm not sure if I can sort things out with my girlfriend.
Client: My girlfriend is the most important person in my life.
Client: She knows me better than anyone else.
Eliza: Tell me more about your girlfriend.
Client: She is the sweetest girl I know.
Eliza: Is there any way to make up with your girlfriend?
Client: I'm not sure.
Eliza: What do you think she would say if you spoke to her?
Client: I'd like to tell her how I feel.
Eliza: What would your girlfriend say?
Client: I'm not sure.
Eliza: It sounds like your situation is quite difficult.
Client: Yes, I'm worried about what will happen.
Eliza: Would you like me to give you some advice?
Client: Yes, please.
Eliza: If I were you, I would try to talk to my girlfriend. I think she will be very understanding.
Client: Thank you, Eliza. That's good advice. I'll try to talk to my girlfriend and sort things out with her.
Eliza: You're welcome. It was nice talking to you. Goodbye.

Eliza's creators have described how the program works. It was based on a large database of conversational fragments. When a user would ask a question, Eliza would search through the database to find a matching pattern. If it found one, it would modify the pattern slightly to better fit the situation, and then use it to respond. This procedure is also known as pattern matching or template matching. Eliza would repeat this process until it had generated a response.

The creators of Eliza did not claim that their program was capable of solving users' problems. They claimed that it could fool some people up to 90% of the time.

Eliza's creators, Weizenbaum and his students, received letters from people who were fooled by the program.

Some people wrote to Eliza to ask for relationship advice.

Eliza is called a chatterbot because it uses a specific set of rules for conversation. For example, in the above conversation, the client talked about a fight with his girlfriend. Eliza then asked him about the fight. The client responded by talking about his girlfriend. The conversation continued in this way. In this case, the program is using a rule that says, if the client talks about a fight, ask him about the fight.

Client: I will not get my diploma.
Eliza: What will happen if you don't get your diploma?

Client: I feel sad all the time.
Eliza: Do you think this sadness will help you in any way?
Client: There is nothing else I can do.
Eliza: I know that you are sad at the moment and you do not think that will help you. I think I can help you with this problem.
Client: How?
Eliza: If you write your thoughts in a journal, you can remember your feelings when you are feeling better. You can think about what you would like to do next time you are feeling sad.

The first public demonstration of Eliza occurred on November 21, 1964, at the Engelberg Center of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Eliza was designed to mimic a Rogerian psychotherapist, and to perform well in text-based interactions. Eliza's interlocutor was a computer scientist, Joseph Weizenbaum. Eliza was able to fool the interlocutor into believing that he was conversing with another human being. Eliza was also able to fool people into believing that they were receiving counselling from a machine. The demonstration of the computer program Eliza at the Engelberg Center was the beginning of the development of artificial intelligence.

The Eliza program uses a set of simple rules to simulate a Rogerian psychotherapist. The program functions by making a sound bite and then receiving a comment from the interlocutor. The program uses a set of rules to determine the next sound bite. The rules consist of replacing the last sound bite with the first sound bite from a previously successful interaction.
