[This post is work in progress]
Advent of Code: The concept is simple: from 1st to 25th of December, every day a puzzle unlocks at 0:00. Each puzzle has two parts, so you can earn 2 stars per day for a total of 50 per year. Over 150k people around the world have participated last year. It's really great to practice programming. I've always used Python, but anything goes, even Excel (but beware...).

I was introduced to Advent of Code in 2018 and quickly hooked. It was a real challenge to solve the puzzles. In 2020 I tried to compete at the leaderboard, which meant getting up at 5:50AM 25 times in a row, which was an experience in itself. 

For old times sake, I've listed my top 12 most memorable puzzles out of 150 (2015-2020, 25 puzzles per year):

### 12) 2020 Day 7: [Handy Haversacks](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/7)
You are presented with colorful bags containing other colorful bags.

### 11) 2017 Day 11: [Hex Ed](https://adventofcode.com/2017/day/11)
Working with a hexagonal grid is a great change from the usual rectangular grids.

### 10) 2019 Day 23: [Category Six](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/23)
A nice puzzle which computers sending packets to eachother. Memorable because I later revisited it to learn about async in python. 

### 9) 2018 Day 23: [Experimental Emergency Teleportation](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/23)
Given a 3D room with many bots that can reach up to a certain distance, what's the spot where you can reach most bots? Seems simple, but the room is HUGE! This makes solving the puzzle a nice challenge.

### 8) 2015 Day 22: [Wizard Simulator 20XX](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/22)
Nice optimization puzzle where you're battling a boss and have to select the best strategy to beat it.

### 7) 2019 Day 13: [Care Package](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/13)
2019 is a very interesting year, where you build your own computer. During day 13, you basically play a version of [arkanoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkanoid) on that computer, which was great to experience.

### 6) 2020 Day 21: [Allergen Assessment](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/21)
For many people probably not very memorable, but this got me the 189th spot on the leaderboard, where I normally hover around 1600. Also a puzzle where I really enjoyed Python elegance with list comprehensions and sets. 

### 5) 2019 Day 18: [Many-Worlds Interpretation](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/18)
One of the puzzles I didn't manage to code but solved on paper. You're in a maze and need collect keys. The keys correspond to doors that open when you find the key. 

### 4) 2016 Day 11: [Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators](https://adventofcode.com/2016/day/11)
The puzzle of the wolf, hen and grain that have to cross the river. But on steroids. I played with duplo blocks trying to find the best solution. Got confused and in the end had to make it into a BFS, which is an algorithm that comes around frequently.

### 3) 2018 Day 17: [Reservoir Research](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/17)
Another one from my first year of participation. You have to simulate water falling down into buckets. Just a great puzzle to toy around with. Just a puzzle with a nice story to it, that's what makes it memorable.

### 2) 2018 Day 10: [The Stars Align](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/10)
A puzzle where you are presented with a set of points with a direction. Again an simulation where at a certain point of time it's litteratly the stars align into a your answer. Felt great joy when I found the answer.

### 1) 2019 Day 22: [Slam Shuffle](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/22)
And the number one, the only puzzle in 2019 I didn't solve in the same day. Take a deck of cards, apply some operations on it and identify the xth card. Easy enough right? Yes, untill that deck consists of a TRILLION cards and you have to apply the operations a TRILLION times. It took me around 20 hours and was so close to breaking and giving up. Wrote a [small post on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/ees6bj/2019_day_22_part_2_story_of_solving_spoilers/) on it. 

I've uploaded my solutions to [GitHub](https://github.com/jvanelteren/advent_of_code). People post their solutions on [the AoC subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/). See you all December 1st 5:50AM!
